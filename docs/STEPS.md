Perfect — your mindset and current structure are exactly on point for a clean, scalable Android codebase. Here's a **step-by-step roadmap** tailored to your priorities and team responsibilities:

---

## 🛠️ PHASE 1: Project Foundation (Structure First)

> *Goal: Lock in architecture, navigation, and project conventions.*

### ✅ Step 1: Define Architecture Guidelines (apply Clean Architecture)

* **data** = APIs, Firebase, local DB (raw sources)
* **domain** = pure business logic (models, use cases, no Android deps)
* **presentation** = Activities, Fragments, ViewModels, and UI logic
* **navigation** = central place for navigation logic using `NavController` or manual intent handling
* **utils** = helper classes (validators, constants, date formats)

✔ Example:

* No ViewModel in `data/`
* No UI classes outside `presentation/`
* No direct Firebase calls inside `presentation/`

---

### ✅ Step 2: Define Navigation Structure

Use **Jetpack Navigation** or **manual Intent routing**, but make sure it's centralized.

* Create a `NavigationManager.java` or use `nav_graph.xml`
* Define all routes upfront (e.g., `Auth → Booking → Cart → Billing → Success`)
* Navigation from:

  * Activities for app-wide flows (Auth → Main)
  * Fragments for inner screens (Booking list → Detail → Cart)

---

### ✅ Step 3: Prepare Shared Resources

* **Themes, colors, strings** in `res/values/`
* **BaseActivity / BaseFragment** for shared logic (e.g., loading dialogs)
* **App class** for global init (e.g., Firebase.init)

---

## 🧱 PHASE 2: Basic Infra Setup

> *Goal: Set up backend access, ViewModel-Repository-UseCase structure.*

### ✅ Step 4: Set Up Firebase Auth & Firestore (only init)

* Initialize Firebase in `Application` class
* Abstract Firebase operations in `data/firebase/` with:

  * `AuthService.java` for login/signup
  * `ChatService.java` (mock now)
* Use interfaces in `domain/` to decouple Firebase from app

---

### ✅ Step 5: Set Up Retrofit (for mocking external API)

* Create `ApiService.java`, `ApiClient.java`
* Put sample calls in `data/remote/`
* Implement `BookingRepositoryImpl` that wraps both Firebase + Retrofit

---

### ✅ Step 6: Setup ViewModel & UseCases

Example for Auth:

* `LoginUseCase`, `RegisterUseCase` in `domain/usecase/auth/`
* `AuthViewModel` in `presentation/auth/`
* Inject `AuthRepository`

Follow this pattern for every screen.

---

## 🎯 PHASE 3: Feature Development (Start with Your Tasks)

> *Goal: Build the three core screens you’re responsible for:*

### ✅ Step 7: Authentication Screen

* Activity/Fragment in `presentation/auth/`
* `AuthViewModel` with `login()`, `register()`
* `AuthRepositoryImpl` using `AuthService`
* UI validation in `utils/Validator.java`
* Follow MVVM strictly

---

### ✅ Step 8: Chat Screen (Mock)

* Simple `ChatFragment` in `presentation/chat/`
* Message model in `domain/model/ChatMessage.java`
* Mock messages in ViewModel
* Use Firebase Realtime Database or local list now, real later
* RecyclerView + simple layout (message bubble)

---

### ✅ Step 9: Map Screen

* Use `MapFragment` with Google Maps
* Fixed LAB coordinates
* Show marker
* Zoom & pan support
* `MapViewModel` if logic is needed later

---

## 🧹 PHASE 4: Team Guidelines & Cleanup

> *Goal: Keep everything modular, debuggable, and clean.*

### ✅ Step 10: Create Team Conventions (in `README.md`)

* Folder rules (no putting UI in domain)
* Naming conventions (e.g., `XxxRepositoryImpl`, `XxxUseCase`)
* Coding style (braces, indentation, null handling)
* PR/checklist rules (one use case = one ViewModel + screen + test)

---

### ✅ Step 11: Add Logging and Error Handling

* Create `Logger.java` in `utils/`
* Create `Result<T>` wrapper for success/failure responses
* Use `try-catch` in `repository` layer only

---

### ✅ Step 12: Finalize Base Templates

* `BaseActivity`, `BaseFragment`
* `BaseViewModel` (optional)
* Common UI components in `presentation/components/` (e.g., Button, LoadingView)

Let me know when you’re ready to scaffold the `AuthViewModel`, `AuthRepository`, and UI — I can write the first screen skeleton with you.
